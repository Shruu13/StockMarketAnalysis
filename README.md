## Libraries Used
* **Keras**: A high-level deep learning library that provides an easy-to-use interface for building neural networks.
* **Sequential**: A class from Keras used to create a linear stack of layers for building the neural network architecture.
* **LSTM**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) layer in Keras used for sequence modeling and time-series data.
* **Dense**: A fully connected neural network layer in Keras used for final predictions and computations.
* **Dropout**: A regularization technique in Keras that helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping some neurons during training

## Results
Provide a summary of the results achieved by your model. Include visualizations comparing predicted prices with actual prices, and any relevant performance metrics.
